# iExcelNetwork
iExcelNetwork is an Excel VSTO add-in written in C# designed to build network visualizations using the [vis.js](https://visjs.org) network library.

## iExcelNetwork Proof of Concept (PoC)
The current PoC has basic functionality:
* Select a range.
* Save the range as a JSON file.
* Build a network based on the selected range.
* The generated network is a basic example using Vis.js Network.
  
The capabilities of the iExecNetwork PoC can be extended. [See](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/) Vis.js Network examples.
